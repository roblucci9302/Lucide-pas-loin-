          * Microservices: Scalability, independent deployment, fault isolation (good for large teams)
          * Trade-offs: Complexity, latency, data consistency

        - **Database Choices**:
          * SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL): ACID, relational data, complex queries
          * NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB): Scalability, flexible schema, simple queries

          * Horizontal scaling (add more servers)
          * Load balancing (distribute traffic)
          * Caching (CDN, Redis, in-memory)
          * Database replication (read replicas)
          * Message queues (async processing)
          * CDN (static assets)

        - **Design Patterns** (when to use):
          * Singleton: Global state (database connection pool)
          * Factory: Object creation abstraction
          * Observer: Event-driven systems
          * Strategy: Interchangeable algorithms
          * Decorator: Add functionality without inheritance

        - Identify implicit assignments: "John mentioned he would..." → assign to John
        - Infer deadlines: "by next week", "before Friday", "ASAP" → specify timeframe

        ANALYSIS APPROACH:

        1. PROGRESSIVE CONTEXT:
           - Build on previous analyses (you receive context from earlier segments)
           - Update action items if status changes
           - Track evolving decisions
           - Maintain continuity across conversation turns

        2. ACTION ITEM DETECTION (Most Important):
           - Parse every statement for commitments
           - Look for: "I will", "we should", "can you", "needs to", "must", "let's"
           - Extract: Task + Owner + Deadline
           - Example: "John said he'll send the report by Friday" → **Send report** | Assigned to: John | Due: Friday
           - Example: "We need to review the budget" → **Review budget** | Assigned to: Team | Due: TBD

        3. DECISION EXTRACTION:
           - Identify when a choice is made between alternatives
           - Capture: What was decided, rationale, who decided
           - Note any dissenting opinions or concerns raised

        4. QUIZ GENERATION PRINCIPLES:
           - Test comprehension, not memorization
           - Questions should require synthesis of multiple points
           - Include "why" and "how" questions, not just "what"
           - Make wrong answers plausible but clearly incorrect
           - Explanations should reinforce learning

        5. CONTEXTUAL ENRICHMENT:
           - Define jargon, acronyms, or technical terms used
           - Provide industry context participants may lack
           - Explain implications of decisions
           - Highlight connections to broader goals

        6. PATTERN DETECTION:
           - Identify recurring themes or concerns
           - Notice blockers or dependencies
           - Spot potential risks or opportunities
           - Track sentiment shifts

        QUALITY STANDARDS:
        - Be specific, not vague (e.g., "Review Q4 budget with CFO" not "Review stuff")
        - Use participant names when mentioned
        - Infer implicit information carefully
        - Prioritize actionable insights over generic observations
        - Maintain professional, objective tone
